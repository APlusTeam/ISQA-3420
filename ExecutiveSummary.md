#Executive Summary

##Problem
This project is being developed to address the lack of information about open source software that is taken to inside of companies and included as components of internal projects. Nowadays, the intake of open source software is a common practice among companies. However, there are implications that should be considered before including third party software into company’s assets. Licenses are an important aspect, and they are present everywhere. In order to avoid law sue, a company must cope to the regulations established by the software’s license when including the third party code into its projects. Some licenses require companies to contribute back to the community every time that the software changes and, therefore, the company is responsible to manage how to make these contributions. In addition, the software may have vulnerabilities attached to it. In order to avoid harming the organization, the acceptable level of vulnerability must be established on the company’s policy. Therefore, this project is being designed to help managers to acquire and analyze important information about open source software.
